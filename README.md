Project to display functionality of web apps using the Djano framework using an virtual environment.
Created view functions and templates for the pages on the website, and used template inhertitance to simplify structure.
Also registered a different accounts app, to allow new users to be registered into a database, so any number of users can interact with this website.
Used the Bootstrap library to configure the styling onto any device a user uses to interact with the website. 
Finally deployed the project onto Platform.sh so anyone can access the site and made custom error pages so they can be handled.
